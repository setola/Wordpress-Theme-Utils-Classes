Wordpress-Theme-Utils-Classes
=============================

A little collection of PHP classes I use while developing themes for WP.

You can use theme in a standalone theme or use [Wordpress-Theme-Utils](https://github.com/setola/Wordpress-Theme-Utils) as parent theme.

include the library
````php
    include_once 'WPTU/WPTUInit.php';
````

and initialize it
````php
    wtu_init()
````
